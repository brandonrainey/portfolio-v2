      <p className="border-l-4 pl-2 border-[#37448f]">
        As a 30-year-old Frontend Developer based in Goose Creek, South
        Carolina, I am passionate about leveraging technology to create
        impactful solutions. For over the past two years, I&apos;ve been honing my
        skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, with a focus on
        developing websites and web apps using JavaScript and
        React.
      </p>
      <p className="border-l-4 pl-2 border-[#37448f]">
        A key project I&apos;m particularly proud of is a responsive e-commerce
        site I developed, featuring Stripe integration for seamless transactions
        and secure user authentication via Google OAuth. I utilized technologies
        such as Next.js, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS to create a
        modern interface and efficient Firestore and Stripe events handling.
      </p>
      <p className="border-l-4 pl-2 border-[#37448f]">
        Short-term, I aspire to transition from a non-technical role into a web
        development position. Long-term, I aim to continually expand my
        knowledge, with the goal of becoming a senior developer and beyond. As a
        self-taught programmer, I&apos;m a testament to self-motivation and have
        a love for learning new things - currently, I&apos;m also learning Japanese.
      </p>
      <p className="border-l-4 pl-2 border-[#37448f]">
        Aside from technical skills, I bring adaptability, effective teamwork,
        and excellent customer-facing skills to the table, developed through
        previous roles. My enthusiasm for problem-solving and continual learning
        motivates me in this ever-evolving field.
      </p>
      <p className="border-l-4 pl-2 border-[#37448f]">
        Outside of professional interests, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the
        latest tech trends, PC gaming, and watching anime. Currently,
        I am actively seeking opportunities as a Frontend Developer and would
        love to bring my skills, dedication, and enthusiasm to your team. If
        you&apos;re looking for a passionate and ambitious developer, please
        don&apos;t hesitate to reach out!
