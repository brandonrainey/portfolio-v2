          Hi, I&apos;m a Frontend Developer currently based in Goose Creek, SC,
          and I&apos;m passionate about leveraging technology to create
          impactful solutions. For over the past several years, I&apos;ve been
          honing my skills in technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, with a focus
          on developing websites and web apps using JavaScript and React.
        </p>

          A key project of mine is a responsive e-commerce site I developed,
          featuring Stripe integration for seamless transactions and secure user
          authentication via Google OAuth. I utilized technologies such as
          Next.js, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS to create a
          modern interface and efficient Firestore and Stripe events handling.
        </p>
        <p className="border rounded-lg p-2 border-[#37448f7a] z-20 relative aboutPanel shadow-sm shadow-cyan-400">
          Long-term, I aim to continually expand my
          knowledge, with the goal of becoming a senior developer and beyond. As
          a self-taught programmer, I&apos;m a testament to self-motivation and
          have a love for learning new things - currently, I&apos;m also
          learning Japanese.
        </p>

          currently seeking opportunities as a Frontend Developer and would love
